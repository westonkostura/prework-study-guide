# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description


The prework-study-guide is to guide classmates through the bootcamp prework, with taking notes through each section and topics that we are learning about. The reason I built this assignment is to get a grasp of light coding, and refresh on the topics. Any questions you may have on the basic of any of these topics, the study guide will help you. The main topic that I learned about is the Git section.
